# prussian

Design system for web and Python. Four modes, script-verified tokens, plotting themes included.

Derived from `madsondeluna.github.io`. Numeric token architecture in the format of `devouringdetails.com`. Easing curves from `motion.dev`.

Prussian 1.3.0.

## Use

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="web/tokens.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="web/patterns.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="web/agent.css">
```

`agent.css` is optional and depends on both files above.

Tailwind v4: import `web/theme.css`, which already pulls `tokens.css` and the `@theme inline` block.

```python
from prussian import mpl, plotly
mpl.use("light")        # light | paper-like | deep-blue | dark
plotly.use("light")
```

Without the package: `plt.style.use("python/prussian-light.mplstyle")`.

Streamlit: copy `python/streamlit/config.toml` to `.streamlit/config.toml` and inject `app.css`.

## Files

```

web/tokens.css                   variables, four modes

## Starting a new project

```
mkdir -p <project>/prussian
cp web/tokens.css web/patterns.css web/agent.css <project>/prussian/
cp templates/page.html <project>/index.html
```

Drop `agent.css` if no model writes to the screen. The template already carries the head, the font link, the twelve-column grid on two axes, the three spacing steps, the skip link and a mode switcher that keeps the mode in the URL.

| Step | Value |
|---|---|
| Link order | `tokens.css`, `patterns.css`, `agent.css` |
| Fonts | Geist 300/400/500/600, Geist Mono 400/500, Cormorant Garamond 300/400 |
| Default mode | `:root`, no class |
| Mode state | `?mode=paper-like\|deep-blue\|dark` and the class on `<html>` |
| `theme-color` | `#F4F6F9` at rest, rewritten by the switcher on every change |
| Version pinned | record the Prussian version the copy came from |

Rules the app layer carries on its own, because no file here can enforce them:

| Rule | Level |
|---|---|
| No hex, rem or ms literal in app CSS; every value is `var(--token)` | Must |
| A missing value becomes a token in `tokens.css`, never a literal in the app | Must |
| Text starts on column 1 or column 9; specimen grids are the declared exception | Must |
| Vertical rhythm uses 24, 48 and 96 only | Must |
| Sentence case in every string, including group headings and buttons | Must |
| Chart series come from `--chart-1` to `--chart-8` in order, never cycled | Must |
| State uses `--status-*`; a chart slot never carries state | Must |
| Every transition names its properties, and only `transform` and `opacity` animate | Must |
| Reduced motion collapses duration and delay, including staggered entrances | Must |
| Copy the language files rather than linking the repository path | Should |

The four-mode claim is a claim about the app too. Click through all four before shipping: a value that only works in light is a defect, not a preference.

## Modes

| Class | Ramp | `--bg` | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `:root` | slate | `#F4F6F9` | default |
| `:root.paper-like` | paper | `#FAF8F1` | long reading, print |
| `:root.deep-blue` | slate | `#0D1321` | blue dark |
| `:root.dark` | graphite | `#0E0F13` | neutral dark |

Through 1.0 the `dark` class was the blue one. It is now graphite, and the blue is `deep-blue`. Migrating from `madsondeluna.github.io`: swap the class and the `localStorage` value.

## Colour

Two 15-step ramps: `--slate-*` (light, paper-like, deep-blue) and `--graphite-*` (dark). Every semantic token resolves to a step.

Slate keeps the Space Cadet anchors: `#0D1321`, `#1D2D44`, `#3E5C76`, `#748CAB`, `#F4F6F9`. Graphite is neutral by construction: OKLCH chroma between 0.007 and 0.012 at hue 265.

### Contrast per pair

WCAG 2.1 ratios, recomputed by `check.mjs` on every run.

| Pair | light | paper-like | deep-blue | dark |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--text` / `--bg` | 17.13 | 17.45 | 17.13 | 17.68 |
| `--muted` / `--bg` | 6.47 | 6.59 | 5.37 | 7.15 |
| `--muted` / `--surface` | 6.02 | 5.87 | 4.02 | 5.49 |
| `--accent` / `--bg` | 6.47 | 6.59 | 6.94 | 9.86 |
| `--secondary` / `--bg` | 3.19 | 3.25 | 2.65 | 5.53 |
| `--border` / `--bg` | 1.39 | 1.47 | 1.73 | 1.79 |

Usage rule: above 4.5 any text; 3 to 4.5 large text and UI components; below 3 decoration. `--secondary` is a border colour in light, paper-like and deep-blue.

Tags (`congress`, `conference`, `symposium`) sit between 7.7 and 11.6 in both dark modes.

Status sits between 5.54 and 8.62. Reserved meaning, never a series colour, always paired with a label or icon.

| Token | light | dark and deep-blue |
|---|---|---|
| `--status-good` | `#376E48` | `#82BB90` |
| `--status-warning` | `#79601B` | `#C9AE6D` |
| `--status-serious` | `#844E31` | `#D89B7C` |
| `--status-critical` | `#864544` | `#D18885` |

## Data colour

A family separate from the interface. The brand slate has OKLCH chroma 0.055, below the 0.10 floor: as a series it reads grey.

Eight slots, chroma between 0.105 and 0.115, fixed order, assigned in sequence, never cycled.

| Slot | Hex | Name |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `#3973B1` | blue |
| 2 | `#9F8322` | gold |
| 3 | `#9E527F` | magenta |
| 4 | `#4C985F` | green |
| 5 | `#745BA5` | violet |
| 6 | `#BA6F3E` | orange |
| 7 | `#1990AD` | teal |
| 8 | `#AC5551` | red |

Order found by exhaustive search over the permutations, maximising the worst adjacent pair. Verified against all four surfaces:

- Lightness band and chroma floor: pass
- Colour vision deficiency: worst adjacent pair ΔE 10.0 (deuteranopia, Machado 2009 at severity 1.0), target 8
- Normal vision: worst adjacent pair ΔE 19.9, floor 15
- Mark contrast: minimum 3.31, floor 3

Scatter, bubble, map and small multiples: three-series cap. Beyond that, group or facet. `palette.series(n)` raises above eight.

Ramps: `SEQUENTIAL` continuous, nine steps; `ORDINAL_LIGHT` and `ORDINAL_DARK`, seven discrete steps validated separately; `DIVERGING` blue to amber with grey at the midpoint.

Never two y-axes on one chart.

## Typography

| Family | Role | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Cormorant Garamond 300 | section titles and names | tracking -0.02em, leading 1, never below 32px, never in running text |
| Geist | prose, labels, buttons, table cells | |
| Geist Mono | numbering, field labels, tabular values, code, identifiers | tracking 0.12em when used as a label |

Scale `--text-11` through `--text-56`; the name is the size. Two clamps sit outside it: `--text-display-section` and `--text-display-name`.

Measure: `--measure-prose` 480px. `.prose-justify` is opt-in, not base.

## Space, form, glass

Space: `--space-2` through `--space-96`, base 4 with half-steps at 2, 6 and 10.

Radius follows the role, not the taste. Nothing in the language has a live corner.

| Token | Value | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| `--radius-surface` | 12px | card, panel, grid cell, sheet, state box, hairline grid |
| `--radius-field` | 8px | input, textarea, select, any text entry |
| `--radius-media` | 8px | image, video, thumbnail, avatar frame |
| `--radius-control` | full | button, pill, chip, tag |
| `--radius-mark` | 4px | native checkbox box, skeleton bar, anything under 20px |
| `--radius-circle` | 50% | avatar, dot, radio, round control |

The ladder is concentric: a child never rounds harder than its parent, so a field at 8 inside a card at 12 reads as one object. The numeric steps and `--radius-0` stay in the scale for imported components only.

Card grid: cells carry no border, `gap: 1px` over a `--border` background, radius and `overflow: hidden` on the grid rather than the cell. Class `.hairline-grid`.

### Glass

Five layers: vertical gradient fill, backdrop blur, saturation, specular highlight on the top edge, refraction on the bottom.

Base class `.glass`, valid on any shape. `.pill` is glass by default. `.pill-solid` for dense tables or already-translucent surfaces.

| Texture | Blur | Fill | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.glass-thin` | 4px | 10% to 2% | overlay where the content behind must stay readable |
| `.glass` | 16px | 42% to 16% | default control: pill, chip, tooltip |
| `.glass-frost` | 30px | 82% to 62% plus grain | surfaces carrying their own text: toolbar, command palette, sheet, modal |
| `.glass-deep` | 56px | 58% to 34% | full-width chrome |
| `.glass-accent` | inherits | accent tint | one control per group |

`.glass-frost` is the only one with grain (desaturated `feTurbulence` in `mix-blend-mode: overlay`). Without it the result is translucent, not frosted.

Shapes: `.glass-sq` (surface radius, the name is kept for compatibility), `.glass-soft` (media), `.glass-round` (control), `.glass-circle`. `.glass-panel` builds an internal hairline grid. `.glass-lift` is the pointer reaction: rises 2px, edge lights up, shadow opens.

Blur radius follows surface size. A large radius on a short element makes Chrome sample beyond the box and paint a ghost block in the first of a row of glass siblings.

Text on glass uses `--text`, never `--muted`: the backdrop is unpredictable. `.card-glass` is exempt, since it sits on a known surface.

Glass does not go over a flat background (no effect, one compositing layer), over another translucent surface, or behind running text.

## Motion

| Token | Curve | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--ease-standard` | `cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1)` | colour, background and border on hover |
| `--ease-out` | `cubic-bezier(0,0,.2,1)` | simple entrance |
| `--ease-out-soft` | `cubic-bezier(.25,0,0,1)` | content, tab transition, chart line drawing |
| `--ease-out-expo` | `cubic-bezier(.16,1,.3,1)` | slide, scale, bar growth |
| `--ease-swift` | `cubic-bezier(.23,.88,.26,.92)` | hover displacement |

Durations `--duration-1` (100ms) through `--duration-6` (500ms). Hover default 200ms. Glass 350ms with `--ease-out-soft`.

Displacement: `--nudge-1` 2px, `--nudge-2` 3px, `--nudge-3` 4px.

Entrance stagger: 60ms per item, capped at six steps. Class `.stagger`.

Everything collapses under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

## Craft rules

Behaviour, not material. Must fails the build or the review, should is the default and leaving it needs a written reason, never has no exception. The binding column names the class or token that already implements the rule.

Five are script checked: `color-scheme` in all four modes, no `transition: all`, no transition of a layout property, the interaction tokens agreeing between `tokens.json` and `tokens.css`, and the presence of a focus ring.

### Interaction tokens

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--hit-min` | 24px | floor for a hit area |
| `--hit-min-touch` | 44px | same floor under `pointer: coarse` |
| `--focus-ring` | 2px | outline width, colour `--accent`, `--text` over glass |
| `--focus-offset` | 2px | outline offset |
| `--field-height` | 40px | minimum field height, 44px on touch |
| `--text-field` | 1rem | field text size, the one exception to one size per control class |
| `--scroll-offset` | 88px | `scroll-margin-top` under a fixed bar |
| `--stroke` | 2px | drawn stroke: spinner ring, checkbox mark |
| `--tap-highlight` | transparent | the native tap flash, replaced by `:active` |

### Keyboard and focus

| Rule | Level | Bound to |
|---|---|---|
| Every interactive element reachable and operable from the keyboard, following the authoring practice for its pattern | Must | native semantics |
| Focus ring visible on `:focus-visible`, group lit on `:focus-within` | Must | `--focus-ring` |
| Focus managed on open, close and delete: trapped in the panel, returned to the trigger | Must | `.modal`, `.overlay` |
| Outline removed without a visible replacement | Never | `check.mjs` |
| Ring switches to `--text` over glass, where the backdrop is unpredictable | Should | `.glass:focus-visible` |

### Target and input

| Values trimmed before they are read | Must | submit handler |
| Unsaved changes warn before navigation | Must | `beforeunload` |

| Placeholder shows the shape of the answer, ellipsis when it is an instruction | Should | `placeholder` |
| Autofocus on desktop with a single primary field, rarely on mobile | Should | `autofocus` |

### State, navigation and feedback

| Rule | Level | Bound to |
|---|---|---|
| URL carries the state: filter, tab, page, open panel, colour mode | Must | `history` |
| Back and forward restore the scroll position | Must | `scrollRestoration` |
| Navigation is an anchor, so modifier and middle click work | Must | `a href` |
| A div with a click handler used to navigate | Never | `a href` |
| Destructive action confirmed, or reversible inside a stated window | Must | `.modal` |
| Toast and inline validation announced through a polite live region | Must | `aria-live` |

| Optimistic update reconciled on response, rolled back or undoable on failure | Should | app layer |
| An option that opens a follow up ends in an ellipsis | Should | copy |

### Motion, touch and drag

| Motion interruptible and driven by input, nothing autoplays | Must | `.viz` |
| `transform-origin` where the movement physically starts | Must | `.viz-grow` |
| SVG transform on a `g` wrapper with `transform-box: fill-box` | Must | svg |

| First tooltip in a group waits, its neighbours open at once | Must | `.tip-group` |
| Text selection off during a drag, dragged element inert | Must | `[data-dragging]` |
| CSS first, then the animation API, then a library | Should | five curves |
| Curve matched to size and distance, controls settle rather than jump | Should | `--ease-out-soft` |

### Layout and content

| Rule | Level | Bound to |
|---|---|---|
| Checked on mobile, laptop and ultra wide, the last simulated at half zoom | Must | two axes |
| Safe areas respected | Must | `env(safe-area-inset-*)` |
| No unwanted scrollbar, overflow fixed where it appears | Must | `overflow` |
| Text container survives short, average and far too long content | Must | `.truncate`, `.clamp-2` |
| Flex child carries min-width zero before it can truncate | Must | `.min-w-0` |
| Empty string and empty array render a state, not a broken box | Must | `.empty` |

| Skeleton copies the box of the final content | Must | `.skeleton-line` |
| Contrast rises on hover, active and focus | Must | `--border-hover` |
| Alignment deliberate: grid, baseline or edge | Must | `.grid` |
| Optical alignment wins over geometry by a pixel where perception disagrees | Should | `.optical` |
| Grid and flex do the layout, not measurement in script | Should | `.grid` |
| Nested radius never exceeds the parent, the two stay concentric | Should | `--radius-field` |

### Text and accessibility

| Rule | Level | Bound to |
|---|---|---|
| Document title says where the reader is | Must | `title` |
| Heading levels in order, first keyboard stop skips to the content | Must | `.skip-link` |
| Anything an anchor lands on clears the fixed bar | Must | `--scroll-offset` |
| Numbers that will be compared use tabular figures | Must | `.num` |
| Status carries a second cue beyond colour, icons carry text labels | Must | `.status` |
| Icon only button carries a descriptive accessible name | Must | `.sr-only` |
| Decorative element hidden from the accessibility tree | Must | `aria-hidden` |
| Native element before an ARIA role | Must | semantics |
| Ellipsis is one character, non breaking space holds 10 MB and Cmd K | Must | copy |
| Dates, times and numbers formatted for the locale | Must | `Intl` |
| Curly quotes, short heading balanced across its lines | Should | `.balance` |
| Brand names, tokens and identifiers marked against machine translation | Should | `translate="no"` |

| Native select with explicit background colour and text colour | Must | `.select` |
| Mutation answers in under 500ms | Must | app layer |
| List past fifty items virtualised | Must | app layer |

| Tested in low power mode and in Safari | Should | device |
| Layered shadows, ambient under direct, borders tinted toward the background | Should | `--shadow-glass-rest` |

Contrast method: `check.mjs` computes WCAG 2.1 ratios and every number published here comes from it. Perceptual contrast is advice on top of that floor, not a replacement: one measure in the build.

### Consuming apps

Framework layer, outside this repository.

| Rule | Level |
|---|---|
| Field keeps focus and value across hydration | Must |
| Field with a value needs a change handler, otherwise a default value | Must |
| Re-renders counted and cut down | Must |
| Date and time rendering guarded against a server and client mismatch | Should |
| Uncontrolled fields by default, a controlled one cheap per keystroke | Should |

## Components

`patterns.css`: `.eyebrow`, `.display`, `.prose`, `.section-header`, `.surface`, `.hover-surface`, `.card-glass`, `.hairline-grid`, `.glass` and variants, `.pill`, `.pill-sm`, `.pill-solid`, `.link-cta`, `.link-muted`, `.hover-fade`, `.tag`, `.status`, `.media`, `.avatar`, `.control-round`, `.fade-up`, `.fade-scale`, `.stagger`.

Interaction layer, new in 1.2: `[hidden]` (forced to `display: none`, so a component with a display of its own still leaves the flow), `.hit`, `.field`, `.field-label`, `.input`, `.textarea`, `.select`, `.select-shell`, `.check`, `.field-error`, `.form-actions`, `[data-loading]`, `.truncate`, `.clamp-2`, `.clamp-3`, `.break-words`, `.min-w-0`, `.num`, `.balance`, `.pretty`, `.empty`, `.skeleton`, `.skeleton-line`, `.overlay`, `.modal`, `.drawer`, `[data-dragging]`, `.tip`, `.tip-group`, `.sr-only`, `.skip-link`.

Visualisation layer: `.viz`, `.viz-crosshair`, `.viz-dot`, `.viz-mark`, `.viz-tip`, `.viz-legend`, `.viz-draw`, `.viz-grow`, `.viz-appear`.

Agent layer, new in 1.3, in `agent.css`: see the agent layer chapter below.

## Agent layer

`web/agent.css`. Nineteen components for interfaces where a model writes to the screen. Depends on `tokens.css` and `patterns.css`. Adds no colour.

| # | Component | Classes |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Loading state | `.loader`, `.loader-grid`, `.loader-dots`, `.loader-orbit`, `.loader-label`, `.loader-time` |
| 02 | Reasoning trace | `.trace`, `.trace-head`, `.trace-body`, `.trace-step` |
| 03 | Streaming text | `.stream`, `.stream .tok`, `.caret`, `.sources`, `.source`, `.followups`, `.followup` |
| 04 | Approval card | `.ask`, `.ask-title`, `.ask-options`, `.ask-option` |
| 05 | Tool calls | `.calls`, `.call`, `.edits`, `.edit` |
| 06 | Task rows | `.tasks`, `.task-row`, `.task-sub` |
| 07 | Chat panel | `.thread`, `.tabs`, `.tab`, `.msgs`, `.msg-user`, `.msg-agent` |
| 08 | Prompt bar | `.composer`, `.composer-field`, `.composer-actions`, `.menu`, `.menu-item`, `.dictate` |
| 09 | Recommendation | `.suggest`, `.confidence`, `.meter`, `.alt`, `.arg-inline` |
| 10 | Context chunks | `.chunks`, `.chunk`, `.chunk-head`, `.chunk-body`, `.chunk-src` |
| 11 | Proposed edits | `.grid-table`, `tr[data-diff]`, `.strike` |
| 12 | Records grid | `.grid-table` with `.tag`, `.num`, `.truncate` |
| 13 | Filtered list | `.filters`, `.filter` |
| 14 | Workspace nav | `.side`, `.side-head`, `.side-group`, `.side-item`, `.key` |
| 15 | Command search | `.palette`, `.palette-field`, `.palette-list`, `.palette-item` |
| 16 | Insight card | `.insight`, `.insight-head`, `.insight-pager`, `.metrics`, `.metric`, `.up`, `.down` |
| 17 | Code block | `.code`, `.code-head`, `.code-body`, `.code-line`, `.ln`, `.tok-key`, `.tok-fn`, `.tok-str`, `.tok-com` |
| 18 | Inspector | `.inspector`, `.inspect-head`, `.inspect-group`, `.inspect-row`, `.numfield`, `.seg` |
| 19 | Selection actions | `.selection`, `.selection mark`, `.selection-bar` |

### Agent tokens

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--stream-step` | `45ms` | delay between two arriving chunks, multiplied by `--i` |
| `--caret-blink` | `1s` | caret cycle |
| `--meter` | `4px` | thickness of a continuous meter |
| `--rail` | `28px` | indent of the trace body under its head |
| `--gutter-code` | `36px` | line-number column |
| `--pixel` | `3px` | cell of the pixel-grid loader |

### Agent keyframes

| Name | Animates | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `prussian-token` | `opacity`, `translateY` | `.stream .tok`, `.code-line` |
| `prussian-caret` | `opacity` | `.caret` |
| `prussian-pixel` | `opacity` | `.loader-grid i` |
| `prussian-bounce` | `scale`, `opacity` | `.loader-dots i` |
| `prussian-eq` | `scaleY` | `.dictate i` |
| `prussian-sweep` | `translateX` | `.loader-label::after` |

### Colour assignment

| Meaning | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Task or metric state | `--status-good`, `--status-warning`, `--status-serious`, `--status-critical` | `.task-row[data-state]`, `.up`, `.down`, `tr[data-diff]` |
| Series identity | `--chart-1` to `--chart-8`, in slot order | dot beside a metric name, chart line |
| Syntax highlight | `--text`, `--muted`, `--secondary` | `.tok-str`, `.tok-key`, `.tok-com` |

A diff tint is `color-mix(in oklab, var(--status-*) 12%, transparent)`. A selection mark is `color-mix(in oklab, var(--accent) 22%, transparent)`. No new hex enters the language.

### Radius by role in the agent layer

| Element | Radius |
|---|---|
| `.ask`, `.suggest`, `.thread`, `.composer`, `.side`, `.palette`, `.insight`, `.inspector`, `.trace` | `--radius-surface` |
| `.chunk`, `.call`, `.edit`, `.menu-item`, `.side-item`, `.palette-item`, `.numfield`, `.metrics` | `--radius-field` |
| `.code` | `--radius-media` |
| `.source`, `.followup`, `.filter`, `.task-row`, `.chunk-src`, `.tab`, `.seg`, `.selection-bar`, `.meter` | `--radius-control` |
| `.arg-inline`, `.key`, `.confidence .bars i`, `.selection mark` | `--radius-mark` |

### Translations from the source

Six behaviours could not survive the rule that only `transform` and `opacity` animate, or the rule that capitalisation has one form. Five were rebuilt, one dropped.

| Source behaviour | Prussian version |
|---|---|
| `grid-template-rows` accordion | `[hidden]` plus staggered `prussian-fade-up` on the steps |
| `filter: blur(4px)` on an arriving chunk | `opacity` plus a `--nudge-1` rise |
| Confidence and progress by `width` | `transform: scaleX()` with `transform-origin: left` |
| Chip reveal by `max-width` and `margin` | `transform` and `opacity` |
| Shimmer by `background-position` | pseudo-element swept by `translateX` |
| `border-radius` morph on the prompt bar | dropped |
| `WORKSPACE` group heading | sentence case with mono face and eyebrow tracking |

### Craft applied

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `.trace-head` | `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` on a real button |
| `.tabs` | `role="tablist"`, `aria-selected`, left and right arrow navigation |
| `.stream` | `aria-live="polite"` on the region, not on each chunk |
| `.loader` | `role="status"` with the elapsed reading inside it |
| `.ask-options` | `fieldset` with a `legend`, radios rather than buttons |
| `.composer-field` | `--text-field` at 16px, never `--text-12` |
| `.palette-list` | `overscroll-behavior: contain`, `.empty` replacing the list with a way out |
| `.task-row` | glyph in the rail repeating state in shape, not colour alone |
| `.insight-pager` | `.hit` where the visual control is under 24px |
| `.grid-table` | `.num` on every column that gets compared, `caption` in `.sr-only` |

## Python API

```python
from prussian import palette

palette.series(n)          # first n colours, raises above 8
palette.tokens(mode)       # semantic tokens for the mode
palette.status(mode)
palette.ordinal(n, mode)   # n steps sampled from the ramp
```

```python
from prussian import mpl

mpl.use(mode)              # applies globally, registers colormaps
mpl.context(mode)          # context manager
mpl.rc(mode)               # rcParams without applying
mpl.finish(ax, title=, subtitle=, xlabel=, ylabel=, mode=, legend=)
mpl.bar_gap(ax)            # surface gap between stacked segments
```

Registered colormaps: `prussian`, `prussian_r`, `prussian_div`, `prussian_div_r`.

`mpl.finish` turns the grid off on heatmaps, left-aligns the title, keeps labels in ink rather than series colour, and shows a legend only from two series up.

Plotly templates: `prussian`, `prussian_paper_like`, `prussian_deep_blue`, `prussian_dark`.

## Verification

```
node tools/check.mjs
```

No dependencies, exits 1 on any failure. It checks:

- categorical palette against all four surfaces: lightness band, chroma floor, protanopia and deuteranopia separation (Machado, Oliveira and Fernandes 2009 at severity 1.0), normal-vision floor, mark contrast
- ordinal ramps: monotonicity, minimum lightness step, end contrast
- semantic tokens in all four modes against the declared floor
- colour consistency across `tokens.json`, `web/tokens.css`, `python/prussian/palette.py` and `python/streamlit/app.css`
- version across `tokens.json`, `__init__.py`, the guide and this README
- absence of a ninth chart slot
- `color-scheme` declared in all four mode blocks
- no `transition: all` and no transition of a layout property in `patterns.css`, `agent.css`, the guide or the starter template; `grid-template-rows` and `flex-basis` count as layout properties
- no hex colour written outside `tokens.css`, the one exception being the `theme-color` meta, which is checked against the token instead
- interaction tokens and agent tokens agreeing between `tokens.json` and `web/tokens.css`
- a focus ring that exists
- `theme-color` in the guide and the template matching `--bg` of the light mode

It does not read `@keyframes` or `animation-delay`. Reduced motion is collapsed by hand in `patterns.css` and `agent.css`, including the delay of every staggered entrance.

## Visual guide

`preview/index.html` renders every token and component in all four modes, with the contrast table recomputed on mode change and a click on any colour copying its token. It loads `../web/*.css` on purpose, to test the files rather than a copy.

Nine chapters: colour, data colour, typography, space and form, glass, motion, craft, components, use. The agent layer is not a chapter of its own: each of its components sits in the chapter that governs it, marked `Agent layer`. The insight card is in data colour, the loader, the trace and streaming text are in motion, the approval card, prompt bar, command search, inspector and selection actions are in craft, and the rest are in components. The craft chapter carries the rule tables above with live demonstrations: focus ring and hit area, a form that surfaces its errors on an empty submit, the three content lengths side by side, and the empty, loading and error states.

Serve from the repository root, not from `preview/`, or the `../web/*.css` imports return 404.

```
python3 -m http.server 8731
# http://localhost:8731/preview/index.html
```

Guide layout rules, applicable to any page built on the language: two vertical axes (columns 1 and 9 of twelve), three spacing steps (24, 48, 96), sentence case, one size per control class.

## Migrating existing apps

`apps/biohub` and its subapps use Bootstrap colours. Import `web/tokens.css` at the top of each `style.css` and swap: `#0d6efd` to `var(--accent)`, `#198754` to `var(--status-good)`, `#dc3545` to `var(--status-critical)`, `#adb5bd` to `var(--muted)`, background greys to `var(--bg)` and `var(--surface)`. Charts move to the data palette.

## Keeping in sync

A change to the language updates three places in the same session: this repository, the "Design language: Prussian" section of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and the `prussian-design-system.md` memory file.
